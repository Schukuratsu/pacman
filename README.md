# pacman
The man who pacs

I have just started at github and was thinking about what should be my first project, then my unfinished pacman project came into my mind and i thoght "Eh, why not?" so here I am.

I will try to make it as simple as possible just as something to get started and possibly increment it in the future.

This is not only to get back in touch with programming, but also to learn the dynamics of github and get in touch with the commmunity, so if you are reading this be sure I would certainly apreciate any help.
